# DSA C++ Template

This repo is for quickly setting up a C++ project that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) and [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/).  

It is intended for practice with the C++ language while doing Data Structures and  
Algorithms problems like those found on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com)

## Instructions

1 - Clone the repo to a directory name of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgndev/dsa_cpp_templ example_problem
```

2 - Run the project init script `project-init.sh`

```bash
./project-init.sh
```

This creates a `build` directory and links `compile-commands.json` to the top level which
helps LSPs work in editors like [neovim](https://neovim.io).

## Building

1 - Change directory into `build`

2 - Run `make`


## Running tests

1 - Add your tests to `tests/test_solution.cpp`

2 - Change directory to `build`

3 - Run `make` to compile `test_solution`

4 - Run `./test_solution` to run the tests.

## Breadth First Values

Write a function, breadthFirstValues, that takes in a pointer to the root of a binary tree. The function should return a vector containing all values of the tree in breadth-first order.

```cpp
Node a("a");
Node b("b");
Node c("c");
Node d("d");
Node e("e");
Node f("f");

a.left = &b;
a.right = &c;
b.left = &d;
b.right = &e;
c.right = &f;

//      a
//    /   \
//   b     c
//  / \     \
// d   e     f

breadthFirstValues(&a);
//    -> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
```
