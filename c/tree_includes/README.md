# C DSA Template

This template is created to quickly stand up a new project for C that includes
Unity Tests and CMake for builds.

## Usage

`git clone https://github.com/jgndev/c_dsa_templ your_dir_name`


## Project Setup

Run project setup to configure the project and create `compile-commands.json` for LSP support.

## Running Tests

Add your tests to `test/test_solution.c` 

Then you will `cd` into the `build` directory and run `make`.

```bash
cd build && \
make && \
./test_solution
```

## Tree Includes

Write a function, treeIncludes, that takes in a pointer to the root of a binary tree
and a target value. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not
the value is contained in the tree.
